Project Title: Sketchy Savings: A "Bad Bank" App

Description/Motivation: To demonstrate my understanding of React, I created a refactored version of a "bad bank" activity from MIT xPRO. My goal here was to add functionality, add validation to form fields, design and build UI components using React, and eventually deploy my application using Amazon Web Services. I will be updating this app for my upcoming capstone project.

Installation Guidelines: Use npm init to initialize this application. Download all packages that are listed on the index.js page. Right now, React is being used. Once it becomes a 3 tier application for my capstone, we will use Express, MongoDB, and Docker. 

Technology used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React

Features: 
--> Home page with information
--> Withdraw and Deposit functions
--> All Data, which collects users who create accounts
